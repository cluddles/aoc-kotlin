# AOC2024

Kotlin-based solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Very WIP


### Secrets

Since sharing of puzzle inputs is discouraged, these are stored in a separate `aoc-secret` submodule.

Obviously this is unhelpful for anyone who isn't me. You can get around this by placing your inputs into the
`aoc-secret` directory, or under standard resources (`src/main/resources/`)

Expected directory structure:
```
project-root/
├─ aoc-secret/      -- OR src/main/resources/
   ├─ 2024/
      ├─ day01
      ├─ day02
      |  ...etc...
```
